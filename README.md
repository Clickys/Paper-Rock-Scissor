# Paper-Rock-Scissor
## Synopsis
Rock-paper-scissors (also known as paper, scissors, stone or other variants) is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a simple fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V). A zero-sum game, it has only two possible outcomes other than a tie: one of the two players wins, and the other player loses.
